# DaisySeed
Daisy Seed is a audio DSP platform to create audio, synthesis and effects programs

# DSP
It has never been easier to start developing your own audio DSP application,
because of the good libraries and a lot of hard work by individuals and boards like Arduino, Daisy Seed, OWL and Teensy.

Mutable Instruments created by Emilie Gillet has impacted the whole synthesis community with a fresh look at how to make modular synth modules,
and they have been copied ever since Emilie stopped developing new stuff, and the codebase that is open source is used everywhere.

In the dawning of DSP it was very hard to get started without working for a company because the development boards and software was really expensive and not intuitive at all. And the internet was not invented yet so the information was very sparse and the DSP processors documentation and application notes was all you could get and it was not free either.

The Arduino can not do real DSP programming because of the limited ressources, but it has got many people into programming embedded systems that was way harder before.
and the Arduino IDE can be a good starting point to develop in a lot of other boards such as Teensy and Daisy Seed.

## What can it be used for
My first digital delay was a 1 unit rack model with 500ms delay and had the usual controls for feedback, modulation and could freeze and act as a simple looper,
but it had only one setting that could not be stored. But it was a great effect for guitar solos.
Chorus pedal was also in the pedalboard but it was analog.
Reverb was not my big thing but i got one in rack format with presets.

After some years i got into the recording with a computer and found that Reaper was for me. And the plugins could do the icing on the cake.
Reaper actually has its own plugin language you can use to develop a plugin for your taste.

VCVRack is another recent add on to the music world where you can create your own synthesis modules.

All your effects pedals and plugins are actually done by DSP programming except for your analog gear like preamps, distortion fuzz, but even now you can get at guitar rig modeller that is totally digital and sounds great.
